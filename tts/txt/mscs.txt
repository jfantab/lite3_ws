The Master of Science program gives students the opportunity to further their knowledge in foundational and applied topics, preparing them for advanced industrial or research positions. 
Students are expected to complete six graduate level courses, two electives, and two semesters of project work. Full-time students generally take two years to complete the program. 
The program is available to students with a bachelor's degree in computer science or a related discipline. 
In order to ensure small class sizes and individual supervision of projects, the size of the program is limited and applications are competitive.
